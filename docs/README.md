# Welcome to the APERC Energy Model

The APERC-EM uses the OSeMOSYS framework and is being customized to meet our needs.

The OSeMOSYS documentation is available at [Read the Docs](http://osemosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)! You can see explanations for sets, parameters, variables, and equations.

The OSeMOSYS documentation is also avilable in the /docs folder in this repository.

More updates will be made.
